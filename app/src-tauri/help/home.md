# Workspaces and Workbooks

An Apicize Workspace is where you set up your HTTP requests to test.  You can also configure ways to populate 
data used by those requests, facilitate authentication, and set up other security measures.

Workspaces are saved to Workbooks.  You can control how information is saved to workbooks to lower the risk
of unintentionally sharing sensitive authorization credentials or certificates. See the section on 
[parameter storage](help:parameter-storage) for more information.
